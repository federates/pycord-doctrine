# Doctrine of Pycord

Welcome! This is Pycord's Code Doctrine standard, maintained and created by the Federates SF. The main goal for this repository is to improve code quality, code safety, and type safety along with making things standard throughout the entire library.

This file specifically outlines a few small things and doctrine layout.

## Doctrine Layout

Doctrines shall be paged out in a simple form. The first title in a doctrine shall act as it's main title and name and the file name of the doctrine should be the name as it but in snake case with -s.

There should only be one big title (titles that start with only one #) and it has to be the title of the doctrine.

### Doctrine Name Specification

Every doctrine name has to specify it's a doctrine, i.e. "Doctrine of Quote Regulation", "Doctrine of the Creation of Tests".

### Doctrine Location

Doctrines have to be inside the Doctrines directory, the only exclusion is this one.

## Quote Regulation

The entirety of the Pycord Repository shall use Brunette's standard for single quote transformation. Docstrings have to be double quotes, while return strings and normal strings shall be single.

This shall effect the guide if future authors find it pleasing.
